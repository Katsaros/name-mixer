# word-mixer
A different way to mix words.<br><br>
## How it works
The program first stores the words that you gave as input in 1 array. <br>
Then it generates 2 random numbers in the range of the size of the previous array.<br>
It is checking that the 2 numbers are different and it creates 2 new numbers by combining these 2 numbers and stores them in a new array.<br>
For example from number 5 and 6 it creates number 56 and 65 and stores them into a new array (if array already created, just push it).<br>
Then the program take the previous numbers (5 and 6) and show the combinated string from the index of the array with the words inside.<br>
For example if the number 5 corresponds to index 5 of the array and the value is array[5]=brand and the array[6]=name then the final 
combination will be brandname and namebrand.<br>
Finally the program print all the combinations in terminal with a pretty and clear way, and also stores them in a new file.<br>
<br>
## Result
That's it! You got your new brandname with a quick and strange way.
